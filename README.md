AmberOS is a project aimed at developing a fully functional x86_64 Operating System. The primary objectives of this project are to expand my knowledge of OS development and gain a deep understanding of the fundamental principles underlying the interaction between software and hardware components. The core components of "AmberOS," including the kernel and bootloader, are written in a combination of C, C++ and Assembly Language, allowing me to delve into these languages' intricacies.

## Introduction ##

AmberOS is an ambitious project that explores the intricacies of operating system development on the x86_64 architecture. With a focus on both legacy and UEFI booting, this OS project aims to encompass a wide range of components, from bootloader development to kernel features and eventually user applications.

## Features ##

### Bootloader ###

The bootloader is responsible for initializing the system, loading the kernel, and transfering control to the kernel. AmberOS, with it's "Amber Loader", supports both legacy and UEFI booting.

### Kernel ###

The kernel is the heart of AmberOS, responsible for core operating system functionalities.

## ToDo List ##

- Memory management
- Interrupt handling
- Syscalls
- Multitasking
- Shared libraries support
- Libc implementation
- PS2 keyboard driver
- PCI driver
- ATA and AHCI drivers
- Filesystem driver
- USB driver
- Mouse driver
- Installer
- GUI
- Applications

## Building ##

AmberOS contains a ``configure`` script that automatically installs all the necessary dependencies:

```
sudo chmod 777 configure
sudo ./configure
```

However, the script was only tested on ``Debian`` and partially with the ``pacman`` package manager and it may not work properly with different package managers. In that case you need to manually install the following build dependencies:

```
make nasm gcc g++ gcc-multilib g++-multilib binutils mtools dosfstools e2fsprogs e2tools xorriso gnu-efi
```

(optional)

```
qemu-system bochs
```

After all the dependencies had been installed you can start the build process by running:

```
make ISO
```

(or)

```
make run_(legacy|UEFI)
```

to run AmberOS, in qemu, after the build.
